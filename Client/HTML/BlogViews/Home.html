    <p class="regular-text small-separation">
        Hi! My name is William, and welcome to my skunkworks! Grab a coke or a coffee and take it all in! And while I am a programmer by trade, I love all things Engineering, and 
        I am obsessed with building things more scalable, powerful, flexible, faster, all packaged with beauty simplicity artistic form. And to have cool shit :). 
        Who needs money when you have the skills to develop anything you want?

    <div class="small-separation">The Vision</div>
    <p class="regular-text small-separation">
        My vision for this website is to just present the projects or the thoughts that I might have, 
        whether that is a project I am working on as a result of what I am learning or maybe a discourse in Theology or Philosophy.
        I just feel like presenting my thoughts is a good way of giving back to the community, to learn to better communicate with others, and to stoke my ego.

    <div class="small-separation">What's Cooking?</div>
    <p class="regular-text small-separation">
        I am currently working on three major projects: Character Generator for Heartbreaker, a Robotics Target, a Data Scrapper for GOT Swords and Ravens Board Game, and 5 others :). 
        Expect most progress to be like 6 months out because I will have more free time in the summer, but I might write some posts on my experience in management in the meantime.

    <div class="small-separation">What Drives Me</div>
    <p class="regular-text small-separation">
        I want to figure everything out. I want to set up my life so I can just spend my life tinkering and messing out, 
        and that means a lot of knowledge about automation, programming, society, relationships, history, farming, sustainability, and probably everything else.
        I want to be here for a while, so I want to make the best of it.
