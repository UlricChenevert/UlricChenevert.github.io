    Artificial gravity fields work on artificial mass, which can be used for a myriad of uses, including but not limited to anti-character shields, launch tubes, gravity cannons, and of course, Gravity Drives. 
    <br><br>
    Gravity Drives consist of a mass block and a gravity generator on the same grid, which creates a “reactionless drive” with monstrous acceleration at a large PCU cost and design complexity.

<div class="small-separation">Drive Cost</div>
<p class="regular-text small-separation">
    • <b>Simple:</b> 1 mass generator : 1 gravity generator = 210 PCU (0.68x large hydrogen thrust)
    <br>• <b>Server PCU optimized:</b> 32 mass generators : 1 gravity generator = 1k PCU (21.8x large hydrogen thrust)

<p class="regular-text small-separation">
    <b>Core Events:</b>
    <br>1. Press key (W, A, S, D)
    <br>2. Influences controllable Object (Thruster, Wheels)
    <br>3. Detect Change (Event controllers, Scripts)
    <br>4. Drive Control (Control thrust, Control Stop)
</p>

<div class="small-separation">Multiplayer / Scriptless Logic</div>
<p class="regular-text small-separation">
    <b>Detect 100% thrust:</b> Use an Event Controller. WASD input creates a detectable 100% thrust for a specific direction.
    <br><br>
    <b>Ensure 9.8 m/s:</b> 20x increase acceleration commands to gravity generator group from a timer block. Each command shifts by 1 m/s² to cover the range. One array per direction simplifies setup.
    <br><br>
    <b>The >5m/s Threshold:</b> If speed is less than 5m/s, turn off gravity blocks; else, turn on. This prevents infinite loops of thrust over-compensation caused by inertia dampeners. Basic thrusters handle the low-speed maneuvering.
    <br><br>
    <b>Visuals:</b> If acceleration is less than 0, stop artificial mass. Not strictly necessary, but looks incredible in action.

<div class="small-separation">Engineering Tips</div>
<hr>
<p class="regular-text small-separation">
    • <b>Null Acceleration:</b> If blocks are on but nothing is happening, check if the opposite side is counteracting the field.
    <br>• <b>Prototyping:</b> Test on a small, one-direction craft before integrating into a capital ship.
    <br>• <b>Debugging:</b> Use an antenna while building to verify your groups are firing correctly.
    <br>• <b>Safety First:</b> Check the gravity field direction twice before powering the artificial mass blocks, or you'll meet the hangar wall very quickly.
