## Quick Reference: What Goes Where

- **SkillsData.ts** — All the skills characters can learn (Jeweler, Smith, Navigator, etc.)
- **EdgesData.ts** — Special abilities and talents that give characters advantages
- **CareerData.ts** — Professional backgrounds with story elements and connections
- **ItemData.ts** — Equipment, weapons, tools, and starting gear

---

## Adding New Skills

Skills represent trained abilities that characters can learn. Open `SkillsData.ts` and find the section labeled "Individual Skill Definitions".

### Example: Adding a New Skill

You're adding a new skill called "Glassblowing" to your rulebook. Here's what to add:

```typescript
export const GlassblowingSkill = new Skill(
    "Glassblowing",
    "You can create fine glassware and vessels. With proper tools and a kiln, you can craft decorative and functional glass items."
);
```

That's it! The skill is now available.

### Another Example: Apothecary

```typescript
export const ApothecarySkill = new Skill(
    "Apothecary",
    "You know which plants and minerals create medicines, poisons, and remedies. You can identify ingredients and prepare them safely."
);
```

---

## Adding New Edges (Talents/Abilities)

Edges are special abilities or talents that give characters advantages or unique powers. Open `EdgesData.ts` and find the "Individual Edge Instances" section.

### Example: Adding a New Edge

Let's say you want to add a talent called "Lucky" that gives characters better fortune:

```typescript
export const Lucky = new Edges(
    "Lucky",
    "You seem to have fortune on your side. Reroll one die result per session that you dislike."
);
```

Done! Now players can select this edge during character creation.

### More Examples

**Weapon Master Edge:**
```typescript
export const WeaponMaster = new Edges(
    "Weapon Master",
    "You are exceptionally skilled with one type of weapon. Choose a weapon type—you do more damage with it than others can."
);
```

**Dark Vision Edge:**
```typescript
export const DarkVision = new Edges(
    "Dark Vision",
    "You can see clearly in dim light and darkness, as if it were daylight."
);
```

**Fast Hands Edge:**
```typescript
export const FastHands = new Edges(
    "Fast Hands",
    "Your reflexes are exceptional. You can draw weapons faster and react before others in combat."
);
```

---

## Adding New Careers/Jobs

Careers define a character's professional background. Every career has a story, narrative details, and connections to NPCs and organizations. Open `CareerData.ts`.

### How It Works

A career needs:
1. A name (like "Blacksmith" or "Wandering Scholar")
2. A story explaining why they have this background
3. Optional: NPCs they know, places they've been, organizations they're connected to
4. Optional: A picture to illustrate the career

### Example: Adding a Simple Career

Let's add a "Herbalist" career:

```typescript
"Herbalist": {
    Name: "Herbalist",
    Story: "You grew up in the forest, learning which plants heal and which harm. An accident or discovery forced you to leave your quiet life and seek your fortune.",
    Other: "You know how to identify and prepare herbs. In a town with a market, you can make decent money selling herbal remedies.",
    AffectedPeople: [
        generateRelationships(EntanglementOrganizationTypesEnum.Master, RollReservations.Lowest)
    ],
    AffectedOrganization: [],
    AffectedPlace: [],
    PartialPictureUrl: "Human\\Herbalist\\Gathering Plants.jpg"
},
```

### Example: A More Complex Career

Here's a "Former Soldier" career with more detail:

```typescript
"Former Soldier": {
    Name: "Former Soldier",
    Story: "You served in an army, learning discipline, tactics, and how to use weapons. A wound, betrayal, or change of heart made you leave. You still carry your training and scars.",
    Other: "You have connections to your old regiment. If you visit a garrison, you can usually find work as a guard or trainer.",
    AffectedPeople: [
        generateRelationships(EntanglementOrganizationTypesEnum.Master, RollReservations.Lowest, "Your Old Captain")],
    AffectedOrganization: [
        generateRelationships(EntanglementOrganizationTypesEnum.CivicAuthorities, RollReservations.Lowest)
    ],
    AffectedPlace: [],
    PartialPictureUrl: "Human\\Soldier\\Military Camp.jpg"
},
```

### The Fields Explained

- **Name** — What the career is called
- **Story** — The narrative of why they have this background (2-3 sentences)
- **Other** — Mechanical benefits, how they earn money, or additional story details
- **AffectedPeople** — NPCs they know (Captain, Master, Rival, etc.)
- **AffectedOrganization** — Groups they belong to or worked for
- **AffectedPlace** — Important locations in their backstory
- **PartialPictureUrl** — Path to an illustration

### Example: Court Official Career

```typescript
"Court Official": {
    Name: "Court Official",
    Story: "You served a noble family as a bureaucrat, clerk, or advisor. Your expertise in law and politics was valuable, but you made enemies. You left or were dismissed.",
    Other: "You understand courts, nobility, and official procedures. You know which palms to grease and how the system works.",
    AffectedPeople: [
        generateRelationships(EntanglementOrganizationTypesEnum.Master, RollReservations.Lowest, "Your Noble Employer")],
    AffectedOrganization: [
        generateRelationships(EntanglementOrganizationTypesEnum.CivicAuthorities, RollReservations.Lowest)
    ]
    PartialPictureUrl: "Human\\Official\\Throne Room.jpg"
},
```

## Adding New Items

Items include weapons, armor, tools, equipment, and starting gear. Open `ItemData.ts` and find the section for the item type you want to add.

### Example: Adding a Simple Item

You want to add a "Rope (50 feet)" to the equipment:

```typescript
export const LongRope = new Item(
    "Rope (50 feet)",
    1,
    "Strong hemp rope, coiled"
);
```

### Example: Adding a Weapon

Let's add a "Spear" as a weapon option:

```typescript
export const Spear = new Item(
    "Spear",
    1,
    "Simple Melee and Ranged, 1d6 damage, Range: Nearby"
);
```

### Example: Adding Multiple Items with Value

You want to add starting coins or treasure:

```typescript
export const TravelingCoin = new Item(
    "Coins",
    DiceRoll.sixSidedDieRoll(),
    "Coins earned from work, rolled randomly",
    1  // Worth 1 coin each
);
```

This means: "The character gets coins equal to a 6-sided die roll, and each coin is worth 1 coin value."

### Example: Adding Specialized Tools

```typescript
export const ThievesTools = new Item(
    "Thieves' Tools",
    1,
    "Lockpicks, crowbars, and specialized tools for picking locks and disarming traps"
);

export const HealingKit = new Item(
    "Healing Kit",
    1,
    "Bandages, herbs, poultices, and surgical tools"
);

export const ArtistsTools = new Item(
    "Artist's Kit",
    1,
    "Paints, brushes, charcoal, canvas, and sketching tools"
);
```

### Fields Explained

- **Name** — What the item is called
- **Amount** — How many (leave empty for 1, or use a dice roll for random amounts)
- **Description** — What it does or what's included
- **Value** — How much it's worth in coins (optional)

## Adding Picture Paths

Pictures/illustrations are shown when displaying character information. They're referenced by path in the career data.

### Picture Path Format

When you add a picture path to a career, use this format:

```typescript
PartialPictureUrl: "Race\\JobName\\ImageFileName.jpg"
```

**Example:**

```typescript
PartialPictureUrl: "Human\\Blacksmith\\Master at Forge.jpg"
```

This points to the file: `wwwroot/Images/CharacterCreator/Human/Blacksmith/Master at Forge.jpg`

### Folder Organization

Create folders like this:

```
wwwroot/Images/CharacterCreator/
├── Human/
│   ├── Blacksmith/
│   │   ├── Master at Forge.jpg
│   │   └── Workshop.jpg
│   ├── Merchant/
│   │   └── Market Stand.jpg
│   └── Soldier/
│       └── Military Camp.jpg
├── Dwarf/
│   ├── Miner/
│   │   └── In the Mines.jpg
├── Elf/
├── Orc/
```

### Steps to Add a Picture

1. **Get your image** — A JPG or PNG file (should be high quality, 300+ DPI)
2. **Create the folder structure** if it doesn't exist (e.g., `Human/Blacksmith/`)
3. **Save the image** into the folder with a descriptive name
4. **Add the path** to the career configuration:

```typescript
PartialPictureUrl: "Human\\Blacksmith\\Master at Forge.jpg"
```

### Tips

- Use descriptive filenames: "Master at Forge.jpg" is better than "pic1.jpg"
- Use `\\` (two backslashes) in the path, not `/`
- Keep image file sizes reasonable (they'll load faster)
- Use consistent, high-quality artwork throughout

## Adding Pages to Your Website

Pages are sections of your website that players can navigate to. This might be your "About Me" page, rules summary, project documentation, or anything else you want to share.

### Creating a Page

Pages are stored as HTML files. You can write the HTML directly or create it in any tool you like.

#### Step 1: Create the HTML File

1. Open a text editor (Notepad, VS Code, etc.)
2. Write your HTML content
3. Save it as `YourPageName.html`

**Example HTML:**

```html
<h1>About Heartbreaker RPG</h1>
<p>This is my custom RPG system. Here's what makes it special:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Point 1</li>
    <li>Point 2</li>
    <li>Point 3</li>
</ul>
<h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
<p>My design approach was to...</p>
```

#### Step 2: Place the HTML File

Save your HTML file in: `Client/HTML/GeneratedViews/`

For example: `Client/HTML/GeneratedViews/AboutThisGame.html`

#### Step 3: Add to Navigation

Edit `Client/Scripts/WebCore/Utility/ConfiguredNavigationOptions.ts` and add your page:

```typescript
import { constructHomeViewModel, 
         constructMinecraftProjectsViewModel, 
         constructAboutGameViewModel }  // Add import
    from "../../WebPlugins/Blog/Utility/ConfiguredViewModels.js";
import { PageOption } from "../Contracts/PageOption.js";

export const navigationOptions : PageOption[] = [
    {FriendlyName: "Home", pageKey: "Home", modelConstructor: constructHomeViewModel},
    {FriendlyName: "About", pageKey: "AboutGame", modelConstructor: constructAboutGameViewModel},  // Add this line
    {FriendlyName: "Character Creator", pageKey: "CharacterCreator", modelConstructor: constructCharacterViewModel},
    {FriendlyName: "Minecraft", pageKey: "Minecraft", modelConstructor: constructMinecraftProjectsViewModel},
]
```

#### Step 4: Create the View Constructor

Edit `Client/Scripts/WebPlugins/Blog/Utility/ConfiguredViewModels.ts` and add:

```typescript
export const constructAboutGameViewModel = () => {
    return Utility.BundleViewAndModel(new ArticleModel("/GeneratedViews/AboutThisGame.html"))
}
```

### Example Pages to Add

**Rules Summary:**
```html
<h1>Core Rules</h1>
<h2>How to Roll</h2>
<p>Players roll a d10 and add relevant ability modifiers...</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Combat is resolved in rounds...</p>
```

**Design Philosophy:**
```html
<h1>Why I Made This Game</h1>
<p>I wanted to create a game that emphasizes...</p>
<h2>Influences</h2>
<p>This game was inspired by...</p>
```

**Credits:**
```html
<h1>Credits & Acknowledgments</h1>
<p>Special thanks to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Name 1 - Artist</li>
    <li>Name 2 - Editor</li>
    <li>Name 3 - Playtester</li>
</ul>
```

### Tips

- Keep HTML simple and readable
- Use `<h1>` for main titles, `<h2>` for sections, `<h3>` for subsections
- Use `<p>` for paragraphs, `<ul>` for bullet lists, `<ol>` for numbered lists
- You can add images: `<img src="../Images/yourimage.jpg" alt="Description">`
- Test your page in a browser before going live
