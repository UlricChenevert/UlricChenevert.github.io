// Component: A component characterizes an entity as possessing a particular aspect, and holds the data needed to model that aspect. For example, every game object that can take damage might have a Health component associated with its entity. Implementations typically use structs, classes, or associative arrays.[3]

    health: number;
    food: number; // 0 - 1
    water: number; // 0 - 1
    sleep: number; // 0 - 1
