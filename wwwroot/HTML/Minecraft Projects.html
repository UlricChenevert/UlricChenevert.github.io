<h3>Smart Super Duper Smelter</h3>

<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>A couple of years ago, I had the great idea of connecting a bamboo
farm to an super smelter array so I never had to think about fuel
anymore. However, it had one major flaw: when the bamboo was depleted
with items in the furnace, all future bamboo would be wasted. More
precisely, with large smelting jobs, the furnace array would deplete all
of its fuel but still have items to smelt, and because it takes 4 bamboo
to smelt one item, when another bamboo was distributed to the furnace
array, it would be burned before another bamboo could be inputted and
more critically before the item could be smelted.</p>
<section id="attempts" class="level3">
<h3>Attempts</h3>
<p>There was a number of solutions I tried to patch the problem -
Creating a buffer between the bamboo farm and the smelter - Increasing
fuel distribution rates - Increasing the relative capacity of the bamboo
farm and the furnace</p>

<h3>Controlling input</h3>
<p>It wasn’t until I learn about digital logic and the concept of
program state (or in this case machine state) that I came up with a more
robust solution</p>

<h3>Elements of the solution</h3>
<p>Raw items are loaded into a intermediate dropper (places one item
into the hopper upon a redstone signal)</p>

<p>The “control” furnace, the furnace that receives the fuel last, fuel
amount is read</p>

<p>When the control furnace’s fuel is high enough, the clock begins.</p>

<p>The clock cycles the amount of time it takes to smelt a item, and
triggers the droppers to input an item. I toyed around with a locked
hopper, but it would just dump their items into the load hopper which
might overwhelm the system.</p>

<h3>Additional Elements</h3>
<p>Only allow full chests of fuel to be distributed (this makes the fuel
distributions somewhat equal)</p>
