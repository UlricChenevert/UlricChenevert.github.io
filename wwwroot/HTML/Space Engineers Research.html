<h3>Premise</h3>
<p>Antifical gravity fielas work an artifical mass, which can be used
for a myraid of uses, including but not limited to anti-character
shield, launch tubes, gravity cannons, and of course Granity drives.</p>
<p>Gravity Drives consist of an mass block and a gravity generator on
the same grid, which creates a “reactionless drive” with monstrous
aceleration at a large PCU cost and design complexity.</p>

<h3>Intergrating the Drive with WASD</h3>
<p><strong>Core Events</strong><br />
1. Press key (W, A, S, D)<br />
2. Influences controllable Object (Thruster, Wheels)<br />
3. Detect Change (Event controllers, Scripts)<br />
4. Drive Control (Control thrust, Control Stop)</p>

<td><strong>20x</strong> increase acceleration commands to gravity
generator group from a timer block (20 commands because each command
increases / decreases by 1 m/s^2 and covers the -9.8 m/s^2 to 9.8m/s^2
case).</td>
<td>Use one array of gravity drives per direction. It will increase more
accleration per PCU and simplifies set up work. You can trigger 9 groups
of the same blocks per page.</td>

<tr>
<td>If speed less than 5m/s: turn off gravity blocks, else: turn on</td>
<td>With inertia dampers, drive will be stuck in a infinite loop of
thrust over compenstation causing extreme pulsing. This also means that
basic thrusters must be used to achieve speed chanmge &gt;5 for gravitry
drive to start. Either way I would recommend a kill switch in
cockpit.</td>

ratio.</td>

artifical mass</td>

<h2>Tips</h2>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>Gravity drives ore on on/triggered but nothing to happening: Check
out if your other side is counter acting the field acceleration</li>
<li>Test on small one direction craft first, then start on an actual
craft</li>
<li>Use an antenna when building to debug if you are creating the groups
correctly</li>
<li>Check the gravity field twice before turnning on any artifical
blocks</li>
</ul>
