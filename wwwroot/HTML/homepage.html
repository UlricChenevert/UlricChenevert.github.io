<h2 id="welcome-to-my-cozy-corner-of-the-internet">Welcome to my cozy
corner of the Internet!</h2>
<p>Its a little rough around the edges, but I hope to fill it with some
neat projects. I really want to document what I do more. I mean, I feel
like information now a days are shifting more and more onto private
applications like discord and whatsapp, so I feel like its good to
pushback, or least feed the Machine Learning models :). But anyways, I
really love projects that have both technical beauty and
artistic/creative beauty, so if you like any of that kinda stuff youâ€™ve
come to the right place!</p>
